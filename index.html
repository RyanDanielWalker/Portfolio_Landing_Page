        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Ryan Walker and I am currently a full-time student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>. From 2014 until 2020, I was the General Manager and minority owner of <a href="https://www.atlaspizzapdx.com">Atlas Pizza</a> in beautiful Portland, OR. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and it appeared that the business might not survive, I made the decision to be laid off. Initially, I was <strong><em>terrified</em></strong>, but over time I began to realize that I was not allowing myself to grow as an individual while investing, almost literally, all of my life in to work. I started attending Portland Community College shortly after to pursue my passion for art, specifically design. A few of my friends started to tell me about a computer programming course they had taken that they thought would be perfect for me. With the hopes of being able to further develop my design skills, and begin a career in which I can constantly learn and grow, I took the plunge and signed up! </p>

        <img src="images/tape.jpeg" alt="cassette tapes" class="tape">
        <p>I have been collecting vinyl records for more than half of my life. With all of the extra free-time I had available during the beginning of the pandemic, I decided to document and share some of my favorite tracks from my collection in the form of cassette tapes. Here is a little information about my process:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>My initial goal was to record at least one song from every album that I have. It immediately became clear that it was going to be a challenge to spread out my <em>absolute</em> favorites. Although I have, what some might consider, a lot of records; I must admit that I do own quite a few that I only have because of one or two songs.</li>
          <li>In an effort to ensure that no two tapes featured too much of any one sound, I decided to try to follow a similar pattern for each tape: </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Start out with a banger. Usually a funk or disco track. Something high energy to let them know I mean business. </li>
              <li>Next, hit 'em with another one. Often this meant another funk or disco track but sometimes a hard rock song would sneak its way in there. </li>
              <li>Songs three through six generally alternated between folk, blues, country western, soul, and instrumental rock. Songs to mellow the listener out a little while still bringing the heat. </li>
              <li>For songs seven and eight, I ramped up the energy just enough to get them excited for side B.</li>
              <li>On the B side, I essentially repeated the same pattern as side A while saving the absolute heaviest of hitters for the final track</li>
            </ul>
          <li>After all of the tapes were recorded, I made custom inserts that included handwritten tracklists and a unique painting for each one.</li>
        </ol>
