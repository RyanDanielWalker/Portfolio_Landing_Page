        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Ryan Walker and I am currently a full-time student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>. From 2014 until 2020, I was the General Manager and minority owner of <a href="https://www.atlaspizzapdx.com">Atlas Pizza</a> in beautiful Portland, OR. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and it appeared that the business might not survive, I made the decision to be laid off. Initially, I was <strong><em>terrified</em></strong>, but over time I began to realize that I was not allowing myself to grow as an individual while investing, almost literally, all of my life in to work. I started attending Portland Community College shortly after to pursue my passion for art, specifically design. A few of my friends started to tell me about a computer programming course they had taken that they thought would be perfect for me. With the hopes of being able to further develop my design skills, and begin a career in which I can constantly learn and grow, I took the plunge and signed up! </p>
